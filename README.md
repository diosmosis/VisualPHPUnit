# VisualPHPUnit

VisualPHPUnit is a visual front-end for PHPUnit.  Written in PHP, it aims to make unit testing more appealing.

## Features

VisualPHPUnit provides the following features:

* A stunning front-end which organizes test and suite results
* The ability to view unit testing progress via graphs
* An option to maintain a history of unit test results through the use of visual logs
* Enumeration of PHPUnit statistics and messages
* Convenient display of any debug messages written within unit tests
* Sandboxing of PHP errors
* The ability to generate test results from both a browser and the command line

## Requirements

VisualPHPUnit only supports PHPUnit v3.5 and above.

## Installation

1. Download and extract (or git clone) the project to a web-accessible directory.
2. Change the permissions of app/resource/cache to 777.

```bash
# from the project root
chmod 777 app/resource/cache
```

## Web Server Configuration

### nginx

Place this code block within the `http {}` block in your nginx.conf file:

```nginx

    server {
	    server_name     vpu;
	    root            /srv/http/vpu/app/public;
	    index           index.php;

	    access_log      /var/log/nginx/vpu_access.log;
	    error_log       /var/log/nginx/vpu_error.log;

	    location / {
            try_files $uri /index.php;
	    }

	    location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass    unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_index   index.php;
            fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include         fastcgi_params;
	    }
    }
```

Note that you will have to change the `server_name` to the name you use in your hosts file. You will also have to adjust the directories according to where you installed the code. In this configuration, /srv/http/vpu/ is the project root. The public-facing part of VisualPHPUnit, however, is located in app/public within the project root (so in this example, it's /srv/http/vpu/app/public).

### Apache

In your httpd.conf file, locate your `DocumentRoot`. It will look something like this:

```apache
DocumentRoot "/srv/http"
```

Now find the `<Directory>` tag that corresponds to your `DocumentRoot`. It will look like this:

```apache
<Directory "/srv/http">
```

Within that tag, change the `AllowOverride` setting:

```apache
AllowOverride All
```

Ensure that your `DirectoryIndex` setting contains index.php:

```apache
DirectoryIndex index.php
```

Now uncomment the following line:

```apache
Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

Edit your conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file and add the following code block:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/srv/http/vpu/app/public"
    ServerName vpu
    ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd/vpu_error.log"
    CustomLog "/var/log/httpd/vpu_access.log" common
    <Directory /srv/http/vpu/app/public>
        Options +FollowSymLinks
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Note that you will have to change the `ServerName` to the name you use in your hosts file. You will also have to adjust the directories ( in `DocumentRoot`, as well as the `<Directory>` tag) according to where you checked out the code. In this configuration, /srv/http/vpu/ is the project root. The public-facing part of VisualPHPUnit, however, is located in app/public within the project root (so in this example, it's /srv/http/vpu/app/public).

Within your project's public root, create an .htaccess file (in our case, it'd be located at /srv/http/vpu/app/public/.htaccess) and paste the following block inside:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !favicon.ico$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
```

### Restart Your Web Server
